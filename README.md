This is my repo to house some of my fun and useless scripts!

mixed_equation_latex_maker.py is a script to convert any linear model or mixed model into its respective latex code. This was
meant to be used for R files. Why would I make an python script for R code instead of writing an R script for R code? Thats a great question!

second_keeb_macros_shortcuts.py is a script to bind macros to a secondary keeyboard. Do I love macros? Does Prof.Monette love ellipsoids?
